I’m a frontend developer, and deep-tech fan on a mission to build things that actually matter. Lately, I’ve been really into blockchain and finance, finding ways to make complex systems feel simple and useful. Some technologies i enjoy working with includes, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Django for backend.
